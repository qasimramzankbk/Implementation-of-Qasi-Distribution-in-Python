# Implementation-of-Qasi-Distribution-in-Python
This repository contains Python code for implementing the Qasi distribution.  

## Repository Structure

qasi_distribution/: Scripts for generating and analyzing data from a custom Qasi distribution.
data_generation.py: Rejection sampling for Qasi distribution data.
likelihood_estimation.py: Maximum likelihood estimation for Qasi distribution parameters.
line_plot.py: Animated line plot for Qasi distribution data.
mle_3d_plot.py: 3D surface plot of log-likelihood for Qasi distribution.
correlation_matrix.py: Heatmap of correlations among Qasi distribution functions.
violin_plot.py: Violin plots for Qasi distribution functions.
surface_plot.py: 3D surface plots for combinations of Qasi distribution functions.


 ## Requirements

### Python 3.8+
Libraries: numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, rstan, MASS, glmnet, Metrics, data.table
R and RStan for Bayesian modeling (install via install.packages("rstan"))

## Usage

### Qasi Distribution Analysis:
Run data_generation.py to generate data using rejection sampling.
Use likelihood_estimation.py to estimate parameters.
Visualize results with line_plot.py, mle_3d_plot.py, correlation_matrix.py, violin_plot.py, and surface_plot.py.
